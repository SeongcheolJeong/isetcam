# ISETCam
[![Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/iset/isetcam/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/iset/isetcam)

Please see the [ISETCam wiki page](https://github.com/iset/isetcam/wiki) for more information.

This is the Image Systems Engineering Toolbox (ISET) for Cameras (Cam).  ISETCam is the base repository that includes routines to represent scenes, optics, fundamental calculations for energy, quanta, color, and software utilities. ISETCam must be on your Matlab path to run ISETBio and most other ISET repositories (e.g., ISET3D, ISETAuto, ISETLens).

This ISETCam distribution originated with a commercial product, ISET from Imageval. The ISETCam code and repositories have expanded significantly. For example, ISET software is closely integrated with physically based rendering and graphics (PBRT) in [ISET3D](https://github.com/ISET/iset3d/wiki). It is also closely connected to models the human visual encoding in [ISETBio](https://github.com/ISETBIO/ISETBio/wiki).

A set of tutorial videos introducing aspects of ISETCam and the companion tool for biological vision ISETBio is available at [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr6PuubdQrtQ-rz5RIe13k3YFrmwBh7gr).

## Python Modules

An experimental Python package is provided under the [`python`](python) directory. These
modules mirror portions of the MATLAB toolbox and can be called either from
Python directly or through MATLAB using `pyenv`. Environment setup and
installation steps are described in
[`docs/matlab_to_python_migration.md`](docs/matlab_to_python_migration.md).

After installing the package (e.g. `pip install -e python`) you can run the unit
tests with

```bash
pytest -q
```

The same test suite runs automatically via GitHub Actions for every push
and pull request, but you should also run `pytest -q` locally after
making changes. Coverage results are uploaded to
[Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/iset/isetcam).

# Notes

### Software architecture

* May 29, 2024 - Please see the section on optics for an update on how ISETCam now relies on wavefront aberrations, represented by Zernike polynomials, to represent shift-invariant systems.  The new computation includes specifications of apertures with non-circular shapes, scratches, and dust particles.
* May 29, 2024 - The separation between ISETCam and ISETBio is complete. ISETBio now relies on the scene, optical image and certain other fundamental functions in ISETCam as a base library. Numerical validations have been moved into the ISETValidate repository, and these include separate ISETCam, ISETBio and ISET3d validations.  Extensive regression testing was performed to validate the new code against numerical calculations from the prior code.
* September, 2024 - Additional support for hdrsensor

### Models

* May 1, 2024 - New functions for creating controlled HDR images have been added (see sceneHDRImages).
* May 10, 2024 - First example implemented for running a PyTorch network, exported as an ONNX file, inside of Matlab using miniconda and pyenv.  See s_python.m
* February 10, 2024 - We added a model for the split pixel sensor, specifically the Sony IMX490. These are based on the prior implementation of the Sony IMX363 sensor. A script, s_sensorIMX490 and related functions have been added. These methods simulate the split pixel capture and include some means for combining the large and small photodetector data.  The algorithms for combining continue to be developed.  A major point of this sensor is for the high dynamic range imaging, such as nighttime driving.  We added an ISET repository (ISETHdrsensor) that is exploring different HDR sensor technologies, including the split pixel.

## Utilities

* May 10, 2024 We work more smoothly with EXR files, including sceneFromFile now reading in EXR files, and writing out sensor2EXR) This work was implemented for the extensions to HDR imaging and application of the Restormer PyTorch network for demosaicing sensor data.
* April 15, 2024 Implemented a remote copy function ieSCP, to help with the distributed nature of our assets and datafiles
