# MATLAB to Python Migration

This repository now contains experimental Python modules that replicate
portions of the MATLAB functionality. The long term goal is to allow
running ISETCam algorithms from Python directly or through MATLAB using
`pyenv`.

## Creating the Environment

Use a dedicated conda environment as described in
[`python/README.md`](../python/README.md):

```bash
conda create -n py39 python=3.9
conda activate py39
```

Within MATLAB, point `pyenv` to the environment interpreter:

```matlab
pyenv('Version','/opt/miniconda3/envs/py39/bin/python');
```

The file `python/s_python.m` provides a step‑by‑step walkthrough of the
setup process.

## Running the Python Initialization Routines

Once the environment is activated (or after `pyenv` inside MATLAB), the
Python initialization mirrors the MATLAB `ieInit` command. In Python you
can run:

```python
from isetcam import ie_init
session = ie_init()
```

This returns a dictionary similar to the MATLAB `vcSESSION` structure.
You can also call `ie_init_session()` directly to construct the session
data structure without clearing the environment.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in [`python/tests`](../python/tests). They can be
executed with `pytest` once the `PYTHONPATH` includes the `python`
directory:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/python
pytest -q
```

Running these tests verifies that the initialization routines and helper
functions behave as expected.
